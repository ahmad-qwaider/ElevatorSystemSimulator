Project Name: Elevator Dynamics Simulator
Description:

This project, developed in Qt C++, simulates an elevator control system within a multi-floor building environment. It aims to demonstrate the functionalities of modern elevator systems using a graphical user interface that interacts with the backend simulation logic in real-time. The simulator manages multiple elevators, servicing floor requests efficiently while adhering to safety regulations and operational standards.

Features:

Dynamic Elevator Control: Manages a group of elevators through a detailed simulation where users can interact with floor buttons, control panel commands, and emergency systems.
GUI and Console Outputs: Features a robust GUI that drives the simulation, accompanied by console outputs that log real-time events such as door operations, floor arrivals, and system alerts.
Comprehensive Safety Features: Includes simulations of critical safety mechanisms like door obstruction sensors, emergency help and fire response protocols, overload detection, and power outage management.
Scenario Testing: Simulates specific operational scenarios as outlined in the design documentation, allowing for comprehensive testing and demonstration of the elevator systemâ€™s response to various commands and emergencies.
Learning Objectives:

Explore and implement the Qt/C++ architecture and framework functionalities.
Develop a test plan and execute simulation scenarios to validate design and functionality.
Maintain an updated requirements traceability matrix that aligns design documentation with implementation and testing stages.
Technical Specifications:

Simulation Environment: The system simulates three elevators servicing a building with seven floors, handling requests from multiple passengers.
Interactive Design Documentation: Includes UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams for success and safety scenarios, state diagrams for elevator and controller states, and a detailed explanation of design decisions and patterns used.
